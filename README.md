# S4-SM-PWA-TC2-AddressGeocoding

This is my first individual app for semester 4 Smart Mobile. This app is a Progressive Web App targeting to help convert text to a location shown on a map.

# About the assignment

As stated earlier, this project was a tech case I had to do for my studies. Down below I have written the exact assignment as I received it. Instead of the API's listed, I used leafletjs.

## The assignment - Tech Case 2: Address geocoding

Using Apple's Maps Server API or Google's Geocoding API create an app that shows a location entered as text.

The user of the app can enter a textual address (for instance Achtseweg Zuid, Eindhoven) and the app will show a map with a marker indicating the address. The map automatically centers around the address.
